# Living Documentation Convention

Lesson 2 (*The Portable Context Stack*) calls out a fourth layer of context usually missing from rule files: the **living documentation** that explains what a project is currently trying to do. Conversations end, summaries are lossy, context windows are finite — durable progress must live in files and version control, not only in chat.

## The four files

All four live at **repo root** with a **numeric prefix for natural sort order** — no timestamp (persistent like `README.md`, see §8 of [`1100_document_naming_conventions.md`](./1100_document_naming_conventions.md)). The order encodes the natural reading sequence: anchor intent → track progress → log choices → distil wisdom.

| File | Purpose | Format | Update cadence |
|---|---|---|---|
| `01_plan.md` | Current objective, sequence, checkpoints. | Markdown checklist. | When direction changes. |
| `02_progress.md` | Active state first, then history. | `## In flight` / `## Next` / `## Blocked` at top; Done table at bottom, prepended newest-first: Date / Task / Verified by. | After each meaningful step. |
| `03_decisions.md` | Durable choices + trade-offs. Append-only at bottom. | Table: Date / Title / Context / Decision / Consequences. | On any decision future-you would need to recall. |
| `04_learnings.md` | Non-obvious constraints, fragile commands, integration quirks. Append-only at bottom. | Table: Date / Title / Non-obvious truth / Implication. One row = one learning. | Every time a non-discoverable hazard is found. |

## Rules

### 1. Stay concise

L4 files are signals, not essays. Each entry should be skimmable in 5–10 seconds. If you need more than 2–3 sentences for a learning or decision, split or trim. When in doubt, remove a cell rather than expand it — a lean table that always gets read beats a detailed one that gets skipped.

### 2. Use the prescribed formats

- **`03_decisions.md`** — table, append at bottom. One row = one decision; delete a row to remove it.
- **`04_learnings.md`** — table, append at bottom. One row = one learning; delete a row to remove it.
- **`02_progress.md`** — Active state first: `## In flight`, `## Next`, `## Blocked` at the top; Done table at the bottom, prepended newest-first (Date / Task / Verified by).
- **`01_plan.md`** — markdown checklist; structure varies with the objective.

### 3. Append to `learnings.md` on discovery

When the agent discovers a constraint, fragile command, undocumented dependency, or surprising default that **would not be discoverable** by a fresh agent reading the code, append a new row immediately — do not let it evaporate in chat history.

### 4. The "what earns a line" filter

If a fact is discoverable cheaply by `ls`, a nearby README, or reading the code, it belongs in the code — not in L4. L4 is for:
- non-obvious local truths (hazards, quirks, half-finished migrations)
- current intent (what we're changing *this week*)
- decisions that look arbitrary without history

Do not stuff L4 files with generic, aspirational, or upstream-available content.

### 5. `01_plan.md` lifecycle

The agent's `/plan` tool writes to `~/.claude/plans/<branch>.md` — the **negotiation record**. When approved, the executable portion moves to `<repo>/01_plan.md`. On completion, archive it to `plan/archive/YYMMDD__<slug>.md` (timestamp convention from `1100_*`) and start `01_plan.md` fresh.

### 6. `02_progress.md` is the session bridge

A new session must be able to read `01_plan.md` + `02_progress.md` and know exactly where to pick up. Mark items done / in-flight / blocked. When blocked, name the blocker.

## What is *not* an L4 file

- `README.md` — project docs for humans; not L4.
- `MEMORY.md` — agent auto-memory, per-machine, not version-controlled; not L4.
- `CHANGELOG.md` — release artefact; not L4.
